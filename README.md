Manual QA Documentation for Banking Application

This repository showcases my manual QA work for a sample banking application.  
The project includes functional testing, regression testing, and exploratory testing across major banking workflows such as login, customer and manager account creation, money transfers, account setup, and related operations.

All documentation is provided as Excel spreadsheets and organized into clear categories.
